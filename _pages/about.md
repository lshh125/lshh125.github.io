I am a computer scientist/bioinformatician. I earned my Ph.D. degree from Rice University, Department of Computer Science. My PhD works were done in Dr. Ken Chen's Computational Genomics Lab at MD Anderson Cancer Center, where I established wide collaboration with biomedical researchers. Before that, I got my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Tsinghua University, Department of Electronic Engineering.
