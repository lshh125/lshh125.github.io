I am a computer scientist/bioinformatician. I am getting my Ph.D. degree from Rice University, Department of Computer Science, trained in Ken Chen Computational Genomics Lab at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Before that, I got my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Tsinghua University, Department of Electronic Engineering.

About bioinformatics
======
[Bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) is a interdisciplinary field that uses/annovates computational methods to process biological data and solve biological questions. It is an everchanging field, absorbing more and more tasks from biology because of the fast advancing throughput of modern bioassays. We constantly get more and more challenging questions, and use the full range of computational techniques to tackle them.
