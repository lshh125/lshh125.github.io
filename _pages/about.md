I am a computer scientist/bioinformatician.

Bioinformatics
======
[Bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) is a interdisciplinary field that uses/annovates computational methods to process biological data and solve biological questions. It is an everchanging field, absorbing more and more tasks from biology because of the fast advancing throughput of modern bioassays. We constantly get more and more challenging questions, and use the full range of computational techniques to tackle them.
