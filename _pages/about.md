I am a computer scientist/bioinformatician. I am a Lane Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Computational Biology, working with Dr. Jian Ma. Before that, I worked at NuProbe USA, Inc., a company innovating cutting-edge seqeucing solutions for disease detection. 

I earned my Ph.D. degree from Rice University, Department of Computer Science. Co-advised by Dr. Ken Chen (research advisor) and Dr. Luay Nakhleh (academic advisor), my PhD works were done in Dr. Ken Chen's Computational Genomics Lab at MD Anderson Cancer Center, where I established wide collaboration with biomedical researchers. Before that, I got my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Tsinghua University, Department of Electronic Engineering.
