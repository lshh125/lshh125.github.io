## Recipes
Under construction... but you can visit this [page](https://github.com/lshh125/recipes).

## Why cook (at home)?
Because Chinese restaurants in the US are doing our culture a disservice.

I like to eat, and I want to preserve original recipes. 
I am not against fusion. It would be hard to imagine Sichuan food without chili peppers, or Italian food without tomatoes. Both are from the Americas. 
Given the abundance of ingredients/foods around the globe, chances are some will pair surprisingly well. 
However, the odds is against me, so I abide by the original protocol whenever possible<sup>1</sup> and necessary<sup>2</sup>.

### Definitions
1. Possible: the ingredient is not unreasonably expensive (or illegal in the jurisdiction I reside).
2. Necessary: the procedure is not known as making little difference in the results.
